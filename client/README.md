## Introduction
- A note-taking SPA, serves the purpose of writing down notes & seperating them into several folders. The front-end is built using React.js & Redux and the back-end uses Node.js, Express and MongoDB. This repository only contains the front-end code, here's the link for the API repository:

- The overall design of this web application is mainly inherited from Google Keep.

## Reflection

This is my first web application that I have written from A to Z - including the API - using the MERN stack. Thus, I have only been aiming to apply & demonstrate through this project what I have learnt so far using these technologies. It is relatively simple and not bundled with a bunch of features.
